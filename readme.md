# CoreOrchard
This is my personal FuseSoC cores library. It contains core descriptions for my own IP and also some from other people
on the internet. For more info on what FuseSoC is and how to use it, look here: [FuseSoC Github project](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc).

You can install this cores library using the following FuseSoC command:
```bash
fusesoc library add --global CoreOrchard https://github.com/adwranovsky/CoreOrchard.git
```
